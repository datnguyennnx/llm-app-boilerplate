# LLM App Boilerplate

This project provides a boilerplate for building LLM-powered applications with a FastAPI backend and a Remix frontend. It's designed to help developers quickly set up a scalable and containerized architecture for LLM-based applications.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

1. `recommender-be`: The backend service built with FastAPI, handling LLM interactions and database operations.
2. `recommender-ui`: The frontend application built with Remix, providing a user interface for the LLM-powered recommender system.

## Development Guidelines

-   Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code in the backend.
-   Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting in the frontend.
-   Utilize Docker for containerization to ensure consistency across development and production environments.
-   Implement RESTful API design principles in the backend.
-   Use pgvector extension with PostgreSQL for efficient vector operations, which is crucial for LLM-based applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start all services
4. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000`

For more detailed information about each component, please refer to their respective `.context.md` files in the `recommender-be` and `recommender-ui` directories.

## TODO

-   Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
-   Set up staging and production environments
-   Enhance test coverage and implement more comprehensive performance benchmarks
