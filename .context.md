# LLM App Boilerplate

This project provides a boilerplate for building AI-powered web applications. It consists of a FastAPI backend, a Remix frontend, and uses PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient vector storage and similarity search.

## Project Structure

-   `recommender-be/`: FastAPI backend
-   `recommender-ui/`: Remix frontend
-   `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for the entire stack
-   `nginx.conf`: Nginx configuration for reverse proxy

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**: Implements Google OAuth for user login.
2. **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket-based chat functionality.
3. **AI Integration**: Ready to integrate with AI models for generating recommendations or responses.

## Development Guidelines

-   Backend development should follow PEP 8 guidelines and FastAPI best practices.
-   Frontend development should adhere to Remix conventions and use TypeScript.
-   Use Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.
-   Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
-   Write unit tests for critical components in both backend and frontend.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `recommender-be/.env_example` to `recommender-be/.env` and fill in the required values
3. Run `make build` to build the Docker images
4. Run `make up` to start the application stack
