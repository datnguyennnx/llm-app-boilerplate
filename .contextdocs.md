# Additional Documentation Notes

This `.contextdocs.md` file provides links to essential documentation for the main technologies and frameworks used in the LLM App Boilerplate project. These resources are crucial for understanding the implementation details, best practices, and advanced features of each technology.

When working on different parts of the project, refer to these documentation sources for in-depth information and guidance. Keep in mind that while these links provide valuable information, always consider the specific context and requirements of this project when applying the knowledge gained from these resources.

For project-specific documentation and guidelines, refer to the `.context.md` files in the root directory and in each main component's directory (recommender-be and recommender-ui).

Remember to keep this file updated as new technologies are introduced or if better resources become available. This will ensure that all developers working on the project have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information.
