# Additional Documentation Notes

This .contextdocs.md file provides links to essential documentation for the main technologies and frameworks used in the LLM App Boilerplate project. When working on specific parts of the project, refer to these resources for best practices, API references, and implementation guidelines.

-   The FastAPI documentation is crucial for understanding how to structure the backend, handle routing, and implement WebSocket connections.
-   The Remix documentation will guide you through frontend development, including routing, data loading, and server-side rendering.
-   pgvector documentation is important for implementing efficient vector similarity searches in the PostgreSQL database.
-   Docker documentation will help with containerization and deployment processes.
-   Google OAuth documentation is necessary for implementing and maintaining the authentication system.
-   WebSocket resources are vital for understanding the real-time communication implementation between the frontend and backend.

Remember to keep these documentation links updated as the project evolves and new technologies are introduced.
