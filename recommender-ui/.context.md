# Recommender UI

This is the frontend application for the LLM-powered recommender system. It's
built with Remix, React, and Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and responsive
user interface for interacting with the recommender system.

## Project Structure

-   `app/`: Main application directory
    -   `routes/`: Remix route components
    -   `components/`: Reusable React components
    -   `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers
    -   `styles/`: Global styles and Tailwind configuration
-   `public/`: Static assets

## Development Guidelines

-   Use TypeScript for type-safe code
-   Follow Remix conventions for routing and data loading
-   Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS utility classes
-   Write unit tests for components and utility functions
-   Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting

## Key Components

-   `app/routes/_index.tsx`: Main chat interface
-   `app/components/ChatRow.tsx`: Individual chat message component
-   `app/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`: Markdown rendering for chat messages

## State Management

The application uses Remix's built-in state management capabilities, leveraging
loaders and actions for data fetching and mutations. For more complex state,
consider using React's Context API or a lightweight state management library if
needed.

## API Integration

API calls to the backend are handled in Remix loaders and actions. Ensure proper
error handling and loading states are implemented for a smooth user experience.

## Accessibility

Maintain a focus on accessibility throughout development:

-   Use semantic HTML elements
-   Implement proper ARIA attributes where necessary
-   Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
-   Test with screen readers and other assistive technologies

## TODO

-   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
-   Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
-   Optimize bundle size and implement code splitting for improved performance
-   Enhance error handling and implement proper logging
-   Implement analytics to track user engagement and feature usage
