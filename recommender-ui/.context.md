# Frontend (Remix) for LLM App Boilerplate

This module contains the Remix frontend for the LLM App Boilerplate. It provides
a responsive user interface for interacting with the LLM-powered backend,
including user authentication and a Langchain streaming response interface using
Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Project Structure

-   `app/`: Main application directory
    -   `routes/`: Remix routes
    -   `components/`: Reusable React components
    -   `styles/`: CSS and Tailwind styles
    -   `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
    -   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks
    -   `lib/`: Shared libraries and configurations
-   `public/`: Static assets
-   `tests/`: Test files

## Key Components

1. **Remix Routes**: Located in `app/routes/`, define the application's URL
   structure and page components.
2. **Layout Components**: Main layout components that provide the overall
   structure for the application.
3. **Chat Interface**: Real-time chat component that communicates with the
   backend via SSE.
4. **Authentication Flow**: Handles user login and session management using
   Google OAuth.
5. **UI Components**: Reusable components for buttons, inputs, modals, etc.
6. **API Integration**: Utilities for making API calls to the backend.
7. **SSE Client**: Manages real-time communication with the backend for
   Langchain streaming responses.

## Development Guidelines

-   Use TypeScript for all components and utility functions.
-   Follow Remix conventions for routing, data loading, and actions.
-   Implement responsive designs using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
-   Optimize performance by leveraging Remix's built-in optimizations and
    implementing proper code splitting.
-   Keep sensitive information in environment variables and never commit them to
    version control.

## State Management

-   Use Remix's built-in state management capabilities (loaders and actions) for
    most data fetching and mutations.
-   For complex local state, use React's useState and useReducer hooks.
-   Consider using libraries like Jotai or Zustand for more complex global state
    management if needed.

## Styling

-   Use Tailwind CSS for styling components.
-   Create custom utility classes in `app/styles/tailwind.css` when necessary.
-   For complex animations or styles not easily achieved with Tailwind, use CSS
    modules.

## Building and Running

To build the application:

```
npm run build
```

To start the production server:

```
npm start
```

## Deployment

The frontend is containerized using Docker. Build the image using the provided
Dockerfile and deploy as part of the overall application stack defined in the
root `docker-compose.yml`.

## Performance Optimization

-   Regularly run Lighthouse audits to identify and address performance issues.
-   Optimize images and other assets for fast loading.
-   Implement proper lazy loading for routes and components.
-   Use Remix's built-in prefetching capabilities to improve perceived
    performance.

Remember to keep this document updated as the frontend evolves, adding new
sections or modifying existing ones to reflect changes in the architecture,
development practices, or key features.
