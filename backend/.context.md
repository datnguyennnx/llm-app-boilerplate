# Backend (FastAPI) for LLM App Boilerplate

This module contains the FastAPI backend for the LLM App Boilerplate. It provides RESTful API endpoints, Server-Sent Events (SSE) functionality for real-time communication, and integrates with a PostgreSQL database using pgvector for efficient vector operations.

## Project Structure

-   `main.py`: Entry point of the application
-   `routers/`: Contains API route definitions
    -   `api/`: API-specific routes
    -   `auth/`: Authentication-related routes
-   `models/`: Database models and schemas
-   `config/`: Configuration settings
-   `core/`: Core functionality and utilities
-   `database/`: Database connection and initialization
-   `alembic/`: Database migration scripts

## Key Components

1. **FastAPI Application**: Defined in `main.py`, sets up the main application instance, includes routers, and configures middleware.
2. **Database Models**: Located in `models/models.py`, define the structure of the database tables using SQLAlchemy ORM.
3. **API Routers**: Organized in the `routers/` directory, handle different API endpoints and SSE connections.
4. **Authentication**: Implemented in `routers/auth/google.py`, handles Google OAuth flow.
5. **SSE Handler**: Located in `routers/api/sse.py`, manages real-time communication for the Langchain streaming response functionality.
6. **Database Connection**: Set up in `database/database.py`, establishes connection to PostgreSQL.
7. **Configuration**: Managed in `config/settings.py`, loads environment variables and sets up application settings.

## Development Guidelines

-   Use FastAPI's dependency injection system for clean and testable code.
-   Implement proper error handling and use FastAPI's built-in exception handlers.
-   Write clear docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
-   Use type hints throughout the codebase for better maintainability.
-   Use Alembic for managing database migrations.
-   Keep sensitive information in the `.env` file and never commit it to version control.

## API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates API documentation. After running the server, you can access:

-   Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
-   ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Deployment

The backend is containerized using Docker. Build the image using the provided Dockerfile and deploy as part of the overall application stack defined in the root `docker-compose.yml`.
