# Recommender Backend

This is the backend service for the LLM-powered recommender system. It's built with FastAPI and integrates with a PostgreSQL database using the pgvector extension for efficient vector operations.

## Project Structure

-   `main.py`: Entry point of the FastAPI application
-   `config/`: Configuration settings for the application
-   `core/`: Core business logic, including LLM integration
-   `database/`: Database models and connection management
-   `models/`: Pydantic models for request/response schemas
-   `routers/`: API route definitions

## Development Guidelines

-   Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code style and formatting
-   Use FastAPI's dependency injection system for clean and testable code
-   Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application
-   Write unit tests for all core functionality and API endpoints

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the auto-generated API documentation at:

-   Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
-   ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Database

The application uses PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for efficient vector storage and similarity search operations. Ensure that the pgvector extension is properly installed and configured in your PostgreSQL instance.

## TODO

-   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
-   Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
-   Optimize database queries and LLM operations for better performance
-   Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
-   Enhance error handling and implement proper logging throughout the application
